Impersonator for Umbraco 10+ lets administrators impersonate other users.

This is useful in cases where you need to check the permissions of editors and other users, if you don't know, or don't want to know their passwords.

When Impersonator is installed, and you are logged in as a user with access to the Users section in Umbraco, you can click your avatar in the upper right corner to impersonate another user.

When impersonating another user, the user dialog is used to end impersonation.
